From [Houston, We Have a Narrative](/notes/-2025---book---houston-we-have-a-narrative---olson2015) Ch. 7

* \_\_\_ AND \_\_\_ BUT \_\_\_ THEREFORE \_\_\_
* A story has a beginning, middle and end.
* Beginning (AND)
  * Facts to set up the story.
  * Joined by AND
  * Word of agreement and positivity
  * "Yes, and..."
  * Starting without tension or conflict
  * From Appendix 1: also, equally, identically, uniquely, like, moreover, as well as, furthermore, likewise, similarly
* Middle (BUT)
  * Something happens
  * Narrative changes direction
  * Establishes tension, conflict, problem
  * From Appendix 1: despite, however, yet, conversely, rather, whereas, although, otherwise, instead, abeit
* End (THEREFORE)
  * Word of consequence
  * Moves things forward in time.
  * From Appendix #1: so, thus, consequently, hence, thereupon, accordingly, as a result, henceforth, for this reason, in that case
* Ex. Some people lived in a village AND they lived in terror because of a nearby dragon, BUT one day a knight slayed the dragon, THEREFORE the people lived happily ever after.
* Note, ABT can also be used to set up a story:
  * There is a small town AND a happy family, BUT the father is found dead on the porch of the house, THEREFORE, they go searching for the murderer.
* Exercise: Describe a painting -> Describe same painting using ABT template
* Possibly originated with Frank Daniel - see speech text from 1986 (Houston, 102â€“103)
* Goal is NOT to use these words, but to build with the template a narrative structure that can stand even without the words.
* Concise vs. compelling -> Often competing concerns
* Craft three ABTs:
  1. iABT - Informational ABT - Don't worry at all about being concise. Long, clunky sentence.
  2. cABT - Conversational ABT - Strip sentence of all compelling information and context. Most generic form possible. Prioritize concision over all else. Leads to the most relatable ABT.
  3. kABT - Add back  important context bit by bit to strike balance between concise and compelling.
* Example three ABTs:
  * iABT - In my lab we model moderate sleep apnea in rats with a chronic intermittent hypoxia protocol in order to investigate the physiological mechanisms of sustained iurnal blood pressure, BUT we have realized the importance of molecular pathways within the central nervous system contributing towards blood pressure control, THEREFORE we have begun exploring novel molecular pathways that develop as a result of our sleep apnea model.
  * cABT - We were looking at one way BUT realized there's another way, THEREFORE we're looking at that way.
  * kABT - In my lab we're studying sleep apnea using rats as our model system, AND we've been focused on physiological mechanisms, BUT lately we've realized the real controls may lie at the molecular level in the central nervous sytems, so AS A RESULT we've begun exploring novel molecular pathways.
