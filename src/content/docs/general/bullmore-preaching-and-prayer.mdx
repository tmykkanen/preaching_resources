## Convictions
1. Working with a text of the Bible is both mind work and spirit work.
2. Spiritual activity calls for spiritual work (i.e. faith expressed through prayer).

## Three Areas of responsibility
Preaching on a *purely human level* involves three areas of responsibility (i.e. three realities preachers are beholden to). These form three key ingredients/virtues of good preaching and work in light of these three realities produces the fruit of preaching.

| Reality | Work | Fruit |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| God's Word | Exegesis | Integrity |
| Particular People | Relational / Pastoral | Engagement |
| Communication | Rhetoric | Clarity |

## The Fourth and Overarching Reality
God as the foruth and ultimate reality presides over all of preaching from start to finish. Therefore preaching must be an experience of communion with God. All genuine preaching is rooted in desperation: "God, I need you."


| Reality | Work | Fruit |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| <mark>**God**</mark> | <mark>**Spiritual**</mark> | <mark>**Power**</mark> |
| God's Word | Exegesis | Integrity |
| Particular People | Relational / Pastoral | Engagement |
| Communication | Rhetoric | Clarity |
