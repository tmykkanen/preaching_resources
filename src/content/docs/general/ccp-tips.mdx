title: Tips from the Chicago Course
---

- Preachers should listen to preaching like athletes watch game tape. Pay attention to what is done and and consider why and how it works or doesn't work.
- Pacing is caught, not taught. Listen to good public speakers (lawyers, stand up comedians).
- We should re-preach sermons more often. Use as an opportunity to sharpen the sermon. Reuse sermons for special events/guest preaching.
