## Five Steps of Sermon Preparation
  1. Text work (~8hrs)
	2. Secondary Reading (~2hrs)
	3. Homiletical Structuring (~1hr)
	4. Writing (~3hrs)
	5. Familiarizing (~2hrs)

## Three Steps of Text work
  1. Determine the *primary claim* of the text
	2. Describe the *development* of the primary claim in the text
	3. Make *significant exegetical observations* (~8 max)

## Significant Exegetical observations
Key to good exegesis is **observable properties** in the text. Think of a thermal image of the text, showing "hot spots." We must find the hot spots that contribute to the development of the primary claim.
