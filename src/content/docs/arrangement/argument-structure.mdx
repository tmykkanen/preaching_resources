title: Argument Structure

## Why start with structure?
The CST worksheet starts with structure work because every author organizes his material in some way. Your initial job is to try to identify this organization (is this a story? A logical argument? A compare/contrast? Etc). This is a good starting point for a homiletical structure. I.e. you should have a reasonable justification for departing from this. But also remember, the scriptures are a WRITTEN document. Communication via writing works different than communication via speech. So as long as the content and intent of the text is controlling the content and intent of the sermon, you can deviate to a different structure if that works better.

## Deductive Sermon Structure
Deductive sermons work best when arguing for a proposition your audience disagrees with. If your audience doesn’t disagree, then you need to do the work to expose the problem (PROBLEMATIZE THE TEXT). Dig yourself a giant hole by arguing AGAINST your proposition in the intro and then spend the rest of your sermon legitimately digging your way out. Additionally, when a proposition is so widely accepted, the main thing we need to do is operationalize the proposition (in which case you’re not actually arguing for the proposition, but applying the proposition).

## Inductive Sermon Structure
Inductive sermons work really well when a question drives the journey through the text. E.g. from Acts 4 — the disciples end up EVEN BOLDER after being arrested; this is weird — what do they know (and we need to know) that makes this happen. Usually the main arg is given near the middle or at the end in these kind of structures. Rule of thumb is to start from the end of the sermon and bring the propositional statement back into the sermon as far as you need to, so that it functions as a rubber band that catapults you from your question through the gospel to the end of the sermon.

## Relationship Between the Argument and Main Points
Generally two structures in deductive sermons:
1. Main Prop: Proven by MP1 > Q/Prob w/ MP1 > Resolved by MP2 > Q/Prob still > resolved by MP3 > Therefore Main Prop is true. (NB: doesn’t have to be three)
2. Main Prop: Implication #1 > True B/C Main Prop > Implication #2 > True B/C Main Prop

Notice, the second structure circles back to the main prop as an anchor for the sermon, whereas the first its the main points themselves that flow logically into one another.

## The Beauty of Two Point Sermons
Most sermons can be preached in two points. Challenge yourself to try a two point structure if you don’t usually. Great options: Question > Answer; Problem > Solution; Example to avoid > Example to follow; Two sides of the same coin; etc.
