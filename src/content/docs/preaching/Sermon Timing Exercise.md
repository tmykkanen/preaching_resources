## This exercise is aimed at growing in brevity and clarity.

Following the steps below have yielded the following benefits:

1. Increased awareness of brevity
2. Predictable timing (especially helpful for children / parents)
3. More ruthless editing, producing sharper sermons
4. Forced to pursue radical clarity in the sermon planning stage.
5. Requires familiarity with overall argument to enable cutting on the fly / thinking on your feet.

## Process (with example times from a recent sermon)

1. Determine the total word count for the sermon and each movement in your argument:
   1. Total word count: 1651
   2. Intro: 212
   3. Point #1: 256
   4. Point #2: 491
   5. Point #3: 620
   6. Conclusion: 72
2. **Calculate % of total word count**
   1. Intro: 12.8%
   2. Point #1: 15.5%
   3. Point #2: 29.7%
   4. Point #3: 37.5%
   5. Conclusion: 4.3%
3. **Multiply % of total word count by total target time (I use 30 min as a baseline) to find out how many minutes proportionally allocated to each section**
   1. Intro: 3.84 min
   2. Point #1: 4.65 min
   3. Point #2: 8.91 min
   4. Point #3: 11.25 min
   5. Conclusion: 1.29 min
4. **Adjust timing as needed (I shoot for 35 min as a hard out):**
   1. Intro: 8 min - I have to account for reading the text, and I’m usually a little slower in my intros.
   2. Point #1 - 5 min - This seemed pretty accurate
   3. Point #2 - 8 min - I thought I could make up some time here, so I rounded down.
   4. Point #3 - 12 min - This seemed pretty accurate
   5. Conclusion - 2 min - I knew this one would be short.
5. **Preach the sermon with a countdown timer**
   1. I write the times directly on my outline. E.g. next to the Point #1 heading it will say 27 min (the min left on the timer when I need to be there) and 5 min (how long I have for that section). It looks like this: (27/5)
   2. If you get to a time marker and are ahead of schedule, you know you’ve got more time to elaborate / slow down / dwell on a point.
   3. If you are nearing the end of your time for a section and still have a ways to go, you know that thing you didn’t want to cut but knew you probably should is going to get the axe on the fly.
   4. As you’re learning, do or die, finish your sermon by your target time. If you fall on your face, that’s fine. The bumps and bruises are part of the learning process. If you embarrass yourself, you’ll probably learn quicker. I believe the congregation will be better served in the long run if we learn more discipline with time, even if it’s a little rocky on the way.
