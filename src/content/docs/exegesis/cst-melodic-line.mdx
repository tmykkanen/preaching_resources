## Principle
Just as every song has a unique melody, every book of the Bible has a unique message.

## Illustration
- Rock 2 theme song appears in numerous scenes; it forms the melodic line for the film, with variations showing where we are in the story.

## Finding the Melodic Line
1. Read, read, and reread the entire book.
2. Look for repeated *lines of emphasis* (e.g. authority in Mark.)
    1. Explicit references
    2. Related thematic references
    3. Contraditions
3. Assemble the necessary components and determine their relationship to one another
    - e.g. from John: Believe, Jesus, & Life

## Using the Melodic Line in Preaching
- Where is this text in the macrostructure of the book, and how does that inform it's interpretation?
- How does my passage *contribute to* or how is it *informed by* the melodic line?

## Example from Mark (given by Mike Bullmore)
Melodic Line: Jesus is the Son of God, so follow him.
1. Jesus *demonstrates that he is* the Son of God (Mark 1:14–8:21)
2. Jesus *clarifies what it means* that he is the Son of God (8:22–10:52)
3. Jesus *proves he is* the Son of God (11:1–16:8)
