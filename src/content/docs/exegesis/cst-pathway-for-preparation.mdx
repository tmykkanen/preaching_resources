## Principle
We must follow a proper sequence to studying the Bible and preparing to preach or teach.

## Four shortcuts to be avoided
<Steps>
  1. Text > Audience = Blind adherence to contextualization
	2. Text > Jesus = Spiritualizing or allegorizing
	3. First Audience > Audience = Moralizing or legalizing
	4. Stopping at Christ/Gospel = no power of persuasion.
</Steps>

<Aside type='tip'>
Many weeks feel like rounding the corner between theological reflection and persuasion, rather than reaching all the way to Christ/gospel.

<Aside type='danger'>
When we mishandle God's Word, we give our people a stone (good luck charm) rather than bread (true food).
