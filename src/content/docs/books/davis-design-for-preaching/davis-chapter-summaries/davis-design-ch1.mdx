## Everything substance has form
- Substance (i.e. content) and form (i.e. the way that content manifests) are deeply interrelated.
  <Aside>
    The incarnation is the ultimate union of form and substance, and therefore demonstrates that FORM matters!
  </Aside>
- Everything has form.
- Form can be careful or careless; organized or confused. But even careless and confused form is form.
- Most elemental form of thought is subject (what) and predicate (what about).
- We respond to form *intuitively*. cf. the design of an automobile or a good joke.
  <Aside>
    Meeks has students at the Chicago Course on Preaching watch stand-up comedians. We can learn much about communication from them. Since form is integral to a good joke, perhaps stand-up comedy can train us to notice form and it's effect.

## Special reasons to be concerned with form in preaching (pp. 5–8)
> [It is foolish] to suppose that if a thought is good it does not matter much how it is expressed.  
> (Davis, p. 4)

1. **The Purpose of preaching:** our aim is a response of thought *and attitude / feeling.* Substance alone is often insufficient to get past our thoughts and affect our feelings.
2. **The exceedingly complex nature of our hearers:** We preach to those who believe in soul but not in mind and those who believe in mind but not in soul. We must reach both, and form helps us.
3. **The Character of God's Word itself:** God's word comes to us in multiple forms (e.g. text types) and requires varied forms to be preached well.

    > How are we to proclaim such a message as this? It should be obvious that the form it takes may make a great difference. If it takes the form of an intellectual argument alone, it is well-neigh certain to fail. If it takes the form of an appeal to self-interest, it is sure to lead back toward self and away from God.

## On finding the right form
- There is no ideal or standard form for all sermons, but there is a right form for each sermon.
- The right form comes from the substance itself.
- The right form is not the end goal:
    > A preacher, therefore, ought to be a good craftsman, but never a mere technician.  
    > (Davis, p. 9)
- Though an over-emphasis on form is a danger, an under-emphasis is a more common danger:
    > A greater danger is that the preacher will be concerned only about the content of his preaching, will never in his life study form enough to begin to master it, and will never become the preacher he has it in him to be.  
    > (Davis, p. 10)
- Talent alone is not enough:
    > Many a man with brilliant talent fails to produce anything; he lacks the character to make the required effort.  
    > (Davis, p. 10)

## On building skill in form
> Art is skill in doing, controlled by an inner sense of rightness, a sense that is nearer to feeling than to calculation, nearer to intuition than to deliberation. Skill in doing may be helped by study, but basically it must be acquired and perfected by practice.  
> (Davis, p. 12)
- We learn our craft amid the busyness of life, therefore we cannot expect any individual sermon to achive the polish of a published poem or novel. But this does not excuse us of the effort.
- Davis calls on the examples of Faulkner, Bach, Mozart, Luther, and Calvin to demonstrate that skill in doing (and great contributions) are developed by steady, week-in-and-out practice. cf. Davis pp. 12–13
> It takes more than craftsmanship to do a work that lasts, but it does take craftsmanship.  
> (Davis, p. 13)

#### The apprentice preacher should study in three directions (pp.13–15)
1. **Read good books on writn and speaking.** And practice what you read. Write, write, write. Speak, speak, speak.
2. **Study sermons of other men.** Study them especially for their craft.

    <Aside type='tip'>
    cf. Meeks on [listening to sermons like athletes watch game tape](/general/ccp-tips/).
    </Aside>

3. **Learn the craft by hard and unremitting practice.**
    > The beginner should plunge in and [preapre and preach sermons] as fast as he can do them with care, for every one will be different.
    > (Davis, p. 15)

## Design for a Sermon (pp. 15–16)
```
A sermon should be like a tree.

It should be a living organism:
	With one sturdy thought like a single stem
	With natural limbs reaching up into the light.

It should have deep roots:
	As much unseen as above the surface
	Roots spreading as widely as its branches spread
	Roots deep underground
		In the soil of life's struggle
		In the subsoil of the eternal Word.

It should show nothing but its own unfolding parts:
	Branches that thrust out by the force of its inner life
	Sentences like leaves native to this very spray
		True to the species
		Not taken from alien growths
	Illustrations like blossoms opening from
			inside the very twigs
		Not brightly colored kites
			Pulled from the wind of somebody else's thought
				Entangles in these branches.

It should bear flowers and fruit at the same time like the orange:
	Having something for food
		For immediate nourishment
	Having something for delight
		For present beauty and fragrance
		For the joy of hope
		For the harvest of a distant day.

To be all this it must grow in a warm climate:
	In loam enriched by death
	In love like the all-seeing and all-cherishing sun
	In trust like the sleep-sheltering night
	In pity like the rain.
